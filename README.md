## Howdy, its articuno115 here with my personal repository.

# I'm currently working on...
how to code in C. I'm taking this class called Real-Time Software Development and I'm excited to learn from this really cool professor who knows pretty much everything there is to know about C.

# Outside of work, I enjoy...
playing videogames, namely BO3 zombies and Rocket League. I just redownloaded Rocket League and hope to become a supersonic legend in both rocket league and C coding by the end of the semester.

## I'm looking to collaborate on...
coding in C. I need to get good at coding before my capstone since I'm one of the software engineers, and this class seems to be a great thing to be a part of.
